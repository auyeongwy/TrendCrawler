Project status and author's motivation
=======================================
This project is a mental exercise that I run during my free time. Some work I set aside to keep myself engaged in software design and development, since I have been doing much less of that in my current role. Hence this will probably progress at a slow pace, and will only be developed and updated till my curiosity is satisfied. It probably won't reach what I consider to be a "production-ready" status. However I will work on it at least till a basic functionalities and a framework is in place that can be taken further into production state.

As of now it is only in pre-alpha stage, so I won't include a user guide yet. However some basic functionalities are in place so I'm starting to track progress with version control.

Introduction
============
Webcrawlers index the internet. So how about a trend crawler that indexes trends on a website? That is what this project is about. Configure the application to point to a website, pull out the text content and try to find trends from it. A different type of webcrawler, if you must.
